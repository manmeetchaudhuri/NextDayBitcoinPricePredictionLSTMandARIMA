# NextDayBitcoinPricePredictionLSTMandARIMA

The aim of this project is to perform exploratory data analysis on cryptocurrencies and to develop a machine learning pricing algorithm that is capable of modelling cryptocurrencies to offer next-day pricing prediction. Also, the results of the exploratory data analysis and machine learning algorithm shall be visualized by using requisite design principles. 
More specifically, the objectives to achieve this are as follows:

1)	Automated and real time data collection: Cryptocurrency pricing data, tweets related to Bitcoin keyword and Google trends data on Bitcoin Keyword are extracted from the relevant websites on daily basis using python scripts. 

2)	Exploratory data analysis: Exploratory data analysis is performed on the Cryptocurrency data, Tweeter data and Google trends data to generate useful insights from the data. Exploratory data analysis is used to identify a suitable cryptocurrency i.e. Bitcoin for further pricing prediction.

3)	Sentiment analysis of Tweets: Sentiment analysis of tweets is carried out to calculate the sentiment scores of each of the tweets.

4)	Time series forecasting: Traditional time series forecasting method (ARIMA) shall be used to predict the next day Bitcoin price based on the historic Bitcoin price data.

5)	Machine learning prediction: A machine learning/deep learning framework/methodology (LSTM) is developed that predicts the next day Bitcoin price using the historic Bitcoin price data, sentiment of tweets containing Bitcoin keyword and Google trends data on Bitcoin keyword.

6)	Comparison of forecasting methods: The accuracy of traditional time series forecasting method and Lachine learning model are compared using confusion matrix, RMSE, MAPE, etc.

7)	Real time next-day price prediction: The best model shall be used to predict the real time next-day Bitcoin price prediction.

8)	Data visualization: The results of all the above-mentioned analysis shall be presented with the help of effective data visualization techniques. Tableau is used extensively for data visualization.
